# IrisFlowerData
### Objective: Classify a new flower of Iris as belonging to one of the 3 classes given the 4 features.
### About: 1936 by Ronald Fisher.<br>
The iris flower has three related species, namely Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor.<br>
It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species.<br>
### Four features were measured from each sample for the aim of separating all the three species(in centimeters):
- Sepal Length
- Sepal width 
- Petal Length 
- Petal Width<br>
### And the classes are
- Iris setosa
- Iris virginica
- Iris versicolor
